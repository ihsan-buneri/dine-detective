 WHAT IS MEM0?
It's a framework designed to enhance the capabilities of large language models (LLMs),
by enabling them to interact with and manipulate memory graphs.
It allows LLMs to reason about complex data structures and generate structured queries,
such as Cypher or SPARQL, to retrieve or update information in knowledge graphs.
MEM0 is particularly useful for applications that require dynamic data retrieval,
such as chatbots, virtual assistants, and data analysis tools.

HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE
The architecture of MEM0 consists of several key components:

+-------------+         +---------+         +---------+         +-------------+
|  User Data  |  --->   |  Mem0   |  --->   |  LLM    |  --->   |   Cypher    |
| (clicks,    |         | Agent   |         | (LlaMA)           |   Queries   |
| views, etc) |         |         |         |         |         | (Neo4j)     |
+-------------+         +---------+         +---------+         +-------------+


MEM0 INTEGRATION
MEM0 can be integrated into various applications to enhance their data handling capabilities.
To integrate MEM0 with your application, you need to follow these steps:

1.Python (backend)

pip install mem0

2.SET UP MEM0 AGENT

from mem0.agents.cypher_agent import CypherAgent
from openai import OpenAI
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-key"

agent = CypherAgent(
    llm="openai:gpt-4",  # or claude, mistral, etc.
    schema="""
    User(id, name)
    Product(id, name, price)
    Hotel(id, name, rating)
    Order(id, total)
    Category(name)
    ...
    """,  # A simplified schema or meta-definition of your graph
)

3.FEED USER CONTEXT TO THE AGENT

user_context = """
User 'u1' searched for 'eco-friendly hotels in Nairobi'
User 'u1' viewed product 'p2'
User 'u1' bought product 'p1'
User 'u1' rated hotel 'h1' 5 stars
"""

4.GENERATE CYPHER DYNAMICALLY

response = agent.generate_cypher(user_context)
cypher_query = response["cypher"]
print("Generated query:", cypher_query)

5.EXECUTE CYPHER IN NEO4J

from neo4j import GraphDatabase

driver = GraphDatabase.driver("bolt://localhost:7474", auth=("neo4j", "password"))

def execute_query(query):
    with driver.session() as session:
        session.run(query)

execute_query(cypher_query)

6.AUTOMATE WITH PIPELINE

 FastAPI

@app.post("/track-user-action")
def track_action(event: dict):
    user_history = get_recent_user_context(event["user_id"])
    cypher = agent.generate_cypher(user_history)["cypher"]
    execute_query(cypher)
    return {"status": "updated"}
